# CS-272 Semester Project - Assignment 1
## ICASSP 2026 Challenge: Cadenza CLIP1 - Lyric Intelligibility Prediction

### Project Overview
This project addresses the Cadenza Challenge for ICASSP 2026, focusing on predicting lyric intelligibility for listeners with hearing impairments. The goal is to analyze and model how well listeners can understand song lyrics when processed through different hearing aid configurations.

### Assignment 1:

#### Dataset
The project uses the **Cadenza CLIP1 dataset** for ICASSP 2026, which includes:
- **Training metadata**: JSON file with listener responses, prompts, correctness scores, and hearing loss categories
- **Audio signals**: Both processed (hearing aid simulated) and unprocessed versions
- **Target variable**: `correctness` - a continuous score (0-1) representing lyric intelligibility

#### Analyses Performed

##### 1. **Foundational Analysis**
   - **Figure 1**: Distribution of intelligibility scores (reveals bimodal pattern)
   - **Figure 2**: Waveform and spectrogram comparison (processed vs. unprocessed signals)

##### 2. **Lyrical Content Analysis**
   - **Figure 3**: Word length vs. correctness (linguistic complexity)
   - **Figure 4**: Word frequency vs. correctness (lexical familiarity)

##### 3. **Acoustic & Perceptual Analysis**
   - **Figure 5**: Spectral centroid vs. correctness (acoustic brightness)
   - **Figure 6**: Edit distance vs. correctness (listener error patterns)

##### 4. **Synthesis & Interaction**
   - **Figure 7**: Multi-faceted analysis across hearing loss categories

#### How to Reproduce

##### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- LaTeX distribution (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX) for report compilation

##### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Activate the virtual environment if any** [optional]
3. **Install required packages**
   ```powershell\bash\terminal
      pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Verify dataset location**
   - Ensure the Cadenza dataset is placed in `data/cadenza_data/`
   - Check that `train_metadata.json` exists in `data/cadenza_data/metadata/`
   - Verify audio files are in `data/cadenza_data/train/signals/` and `data/cadenza_data/train/unprocessed/`

5. **Run the analysis notebook**

6. **Compile the LaTeX report**
   ```powershell
   cd report
   pdflatex report.tex
   ```

#### Expected Outputs
After running the notebook, you should have:
- 7 PDF figures in the `plots/` directory
- Data analysis with statistics printed in the notebook

#### Notes
- **Audio processing** is performed on the whole dataset, hence the code may look stuck in the cell where all the audio is loaded.
- **Metadata analysis** uses the full dataset for maximum statistical power
- The `'#'` symbol in responses represents cases where listeners could not identify any words (correctness = 0.0). These are valid data points representing the lowest intelligibility and are included in all analyses
- Edit distance calculations handle `'#'` responses by returning NaN for that specific metric, as Levenshtein distance is undefined for non-transcription symbols
- All figures are generated in PDF format suitable for publication
